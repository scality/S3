This docker container spawns a hashicorp vault/kmip server for integration
test purpose.

Please note, the server does not setup TLS communication with the clients.

The kmip scope and role are defined at the beginning of the setup.sh script:
SCOPE="scality-s3c"
ROLE="admin"

When running this container, you have to set an environment variable called
"LICENSE" containing the hashicorp vault license. The license value is
available in the CI secrets with the key "hashicorp_vault_license".

The whole container is setup and ready when it is also listening on HTTP. This
should be used to coordinate test start. On this web server, the tester can get
the kmip ca.pem, cert.pem, and key.pem at /ca.pem /cert.pem and /key.pem URIs.
